                        Hello, world is used in coding and programming as the most basic way to show the function or syntax of the code or program. It's an easy thing to attempt to output when testing.

                    <p>
                        So, hello world!

                        This workshop is a basic introduction to front-end coding, which creates the visible visual elements of a website such as buttons, text, colours, and image placement.

                            Front-end development is also called client-side development. Basically this means that it makes what the user sees and interacts with.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Website development is split into two kinds of code - we call it front-end development and back-end development. Front-end development is made up of coding languages such as
                            <strong>HTML</strong>,
                            <strong>CSS</strong>, and
                            <strong>Javascript</strong>, and back-end development has a multitude of languages. I’m a front-end developer so that’s going to be the focus of the workshop. It takes both to make a functioning, interactive website.

                    <p>
                        Building your HTML and making it look nice with CSS is a little bit like building a house.
                    </p>

                    <img src="img/illustrations/house-analogy.gif"/>
                    <p>
                        The designer and architect &mdash; web designer and user experience (UX) designer &mdash; draw out and design the look and feel of the house (web design), as well as creating blueprints (wireframes).
                    </p>
                    <blockquote>
                        User Experience Designer creates outline of website, Web Designer uses that outline and makes it look nice.
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>
                        Then, we build the frame of the house, which is HTML. HTML lays out the foundation and structure of the website.
                    </p>
                    <blockquote>
                        HTML lays out the structure of the website.
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>
                        CSS tells the HTML what to look like. It can change an element's colour, size, position, shape, and more. CSS is the decorating of the house - everything from wall colour to roof tile to shape of the windows. CSS can also handle minor interactions
                        like changing a button's colour when you hover over it, but for more user advanced interaction, we would need to use Javascript.
                    </p>
                    <blockquote>
                        CSS tells HTML what to do. Usually it's to make it look good. (CSS got HTML's back.)
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>
                        To complete the analogy, the back-end code would be the electricians, plumbers, etc. coming in to put in wiring for electricity to the light switches and pipes so that you would have running water when you turn on the faucet.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There are also other components to creating your own website and putting it online, just like how there are prerequisites to owning a house. You would have to purchase a plot of land to place your house (a host to host your website) and an address so
                        that people can get to your cool digs (a domain, like a .com or .ca).
                    </p>

                    <h1>Let's start

                    </h1>
                    <p>
                        We're going to be using a website called
                        <a target="_blank" href="http://codepen.io">codepen</a>
                        to learn the basics of setting up an html site and making it look nice with some css. An account isn't necessary but feel free to create one - it allows you to save your projects, fork off of others and to save your favourite projects from other
                        people.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Before we start, let's go over how a real HTML page is structured. Because codepen does all of this for you, we're not going to worry about the setup, but understanding how the page is put together is going to make more sense for when we style things
                        with CSS later on.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <img src="img/html-structure.png"/>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Tags are used in HTML and are always structured in pairs - opening and closing tags. The only difference between the opening and closing tag is a slash before the tag name.
                    </p>
                    <blockquote>
                        HTML files are created as page.html
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>
                        In codepen, all of the setting up is done for you so basically you are putting your content where it's supposed to be - between the &lt;body&gt; tags.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        CSS is structured differently than HTML as it's a different language, but we're going to talk about that in a bit. For now, we need to know that for the browser to understand that we want the CSS to interact with your HTML, we have to add the file
                        into the HTML page structure. This goes between the &lt;head&gt; tags and everything between there is hidden from the user. Codepen does all of this for you automatically as well!
                    </p>
                    <blockquote>
                        CSS files end with .css - usually we name them style.css or main.css

                    <p>CSS also has opening and closing indicators but they are curly brackets. In the code example below - the selector is body, which means we are telling everything inside the curly braces after body to do a certain thing. In this case, we want to
                        change the body's background color to light blue and set all HTML elements inside body to be 12px.</p>

                                choice.

                                complete replacement for a code editor if you are going to be making your own website, but it makes a great starting point.

                                There are many hosting sites out there, but I use Canadian Web Hosting for my portfolio site. It's good for small sites and cheap.

                            <p>
                                I also use namecheap to buy domains (sometimes they have really good sales) and they also offer hosting, so you can get it all in one place, which makes it a little easier.
