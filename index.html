                    Hello, world is used in coding and programming as the most basic way to show the function or syntax of the code or program. It's an easy thing to attempt to output when testing.

                        Front-end development is also called client-side development. Basically this means that it makes what the user sees and interacts with.

                        Website development is split into two kinds of code - we call it front-end development and back-end development. Front-end development is made up of coding languages such as HTML, CSS, and Javascript, and back-end development has a multitude of
                        languages - the most common are .NET and PHP, but also has other ones that I’m not as familiar with. I’m a front-end developer so that’s going to be the focus of the workshop
